Maat Roadmap
============

Features, improvements, bug fixes, etc. currently on our development roadmap, 
and an overview of our current status.

Current Status 
--------------

The Maat framework is currently a prototype implementation of the research 
presented in "A Platform Service for Remote Integrity Measurement and 
Attestation" (Pendergrass et al., 2018). 

Maat currently supports CentOS 7.7, and Ubuntu 18.04.4.

The following features are supported: 

 - AM listens on UNIX and INET domain sockets for measurement requests
 - AM negotiates a Copland phrase to execute based on attributes of 
   the current scenario and the loaded XML-based selection policy
 - AM forks the APB/measurement spec pair that implements the selected 
   Copland phrase
 - APBs fork ASP(s) required to complete appraisal/attestation
 - demonstration APB for Userspace measurement, with and without a 
   stubbed out runtime kernel measurement placeholder
 - demonstration APB for hashing all the files in a directory
 - demonstration APB for process measurement
 - ASPs to support the APBs included
 - storage of measurements in filesystem-backed graph structure
 - basic user interface for requesting measurement via a web-based GUI 
   and message queues
 - packaging of source code into RPMs/Debian packages
 - initial (likely overly permissive) SELinux policy for measurements included
   in tutorials. Very basic, experimental SELinux policy for all other ASPs/APBs

|        |         | Appraisal Negotiation  | Appraisal Copland phrase should also be part of the negotiation            |
|        |         | Selection Policy Revamp| Selection policy is needlessly complex                                     |

|        |         | Generate tag Copland Compiler | Add a tag to the beginning of files generated by copland compiler to show they were generated |

Bug Fixes 
---------

| Status | Issue # | Title               | Short Description  | 
|:------:|:-------:|---------------------|--------------------|
|        |         | APB Copland Overlap | APBs with the same phrase and number of arguments, but different types will conflict in current implementation |

|        |         | UI Pretty Print     | On modern systems, the old method of printing results to the UI is broken. Update to make results easier to view on UI |
