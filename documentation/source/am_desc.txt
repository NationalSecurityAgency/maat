Definition
-----------

An attestation manager (AM) provides a front door for the M&A
architecture. AMs are responsible for awaiting connections,
negotiating the attestation protocol block (APB) to be used, and
specifying the measurement evidence to be collected. The AM is somewhat 
similar to the classic UNIX inetd super-server in that it is primarily 
a connection dispatcher rather than a work unit in its own right. 
The main difference is that during negotiation the AM is responsible 
for enforcing a selection criteria that ensures a suitable protocol/evidence 
pair is used, and a security policy that ensures the other end of the 
attestation is authorized to use the selected protocol/evidence pair. See the
documentation for am/am.h and am/contracts.h for more details on the
structure and role of the AM. The libmaat_am library implements most of the
attestation manager constructs; the primary element left to clients is
setting up and listening on communication channels.

The Attestation Manager can run in the role of Attester or Appraiser.

AM Taking on the Appraiser Role
---------------------------------

When an Attestation Manager recieves a measurement request contract, it will automatically take on the
role of Appraiser. Using the request recieved from a client, the Appraiser will negotiate
with the Attester and certify that measurements received from the Attester are valid,
indicating that the machine that the Attester is running on can be trusted.

   Appraiser State Machine

.. note::
   The security authorization shown in this diagram is currently a work in progress

The figure above demonstrates the state machine for the Attestation Manager acting as an Appraiser. 
The AM enters its Initial state when it receives a measurement request contract.
It then obtains security authorization if necessary.
Next it sends an initial contract to the Attester,
receives the modified contract,
and concludes negotiation in the Final Selection state
by choosing a Copland Phrase from the contract.
Then it sends the resulting execute contract to the Appraiser,
moving to the Execute Protocol state.
Finally, the Appraiser AM receives the measurement results, evaluates them,
and handles them as appropriate for the situation
(sending back to the requester, storing in a database, etc.)
before ultimately moving to the Complete state.

AM Taking on the Attester Role
--------------------------------

When an Attestation Manager receives an initial contract, it will automatically assume the role of 
Attester. As an Attester, the AM will respond to initial contracts by reporting what measurements 
it is willing and able to take. It will also perform measurements requested by the Appraiser in 
an appropriately-negotiated execute contract, and send the measurement results to the
Appraiser for review.

   Attester State Machine

The figure above demonstrates the state machine for the Attestation Manager running in the role of Attester.
The AM receives an initial contract and moves to its Modify state.
It then obtains security authorization if necessary.
Next it negotiates with the Appraiser by sending a modified contract,
receiving the execute contract,
and validating the contract in the Check Selection state.
Then it performs any requested measurements in the Execute Protocol state.
Finally, the Attester AM returns the measurement results to the Appraiser
and moves into the Complete state.
