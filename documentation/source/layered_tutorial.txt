Introduction
============

These instructions give you the steps to set up and perform a multi-realm
appraisal demonstration. In this scenario, a relying party wants to determine if
an application that is operating in an unprivileged domain of a hypervisor
platform is in an expected state.  A dedicated measurement domain on the
platform would negotiate what measurement of the overall hypervisor platform
would be taken and, in turn, request various other components on the platform
contribute measurements to produce a holistic picture of the attesting
environment.

In specific, the measurement would be composed of a strictly ordered set of a
KIM and userspace measurement of the most privileged domain (Dom0), the
measurement domain itself (DomM), and a designated target domain hosting a
userland application of some interest (DomT).  These measurements will be
bundled by the measurement APB operating in DomM and then sent to another
platform to be appraised, the result of which will be returned to the test
client.

One important detail is that the strict measurement ordering enforced in this
APB allows an appraiser to justify acceptance of the validity of measurements of
less privileged domains based on successful appraisals of more privileged
domains. Such appraisals demonstrate that the state of operational interfaces
that higher privilege levels provide to lower privilege domains are in an
expected state, which in turn provides the basis to infer that measurements
taken of lower privilege levels that result in a passing appraisal have not been
manipulated by an adversary in a higher privilege level.  In effect, a chain of
measurements is created, rooted in a hardware protected measurement of the
hypervisor itself, that constrains how an adversary is able to manipulate the
platform in a way that cannot be detected by one or more measurements.

Another important detail is that the AM in DomM effectively acts as a broker for
attestation requests with the hypervisor platform. The AM in DomM is installed
with a selection policy that allows it to negotiate over Copland phrases that
represent the platform holistically. Additionally, the AMs on the platform are
configured to accept requests for measurements from the AM in the DomM without
any negotiation. In this way, the negotiation policy is effectively encoded in
the AM on the DomM and it operates on behalf of the platform to negotiate
acceptable attestations. There would be substantial overhead in requiring an
appraiser to negotiate with every single component of the platform, and
furthermore it is challenging to characterize how the appraiser and relying
party should proceed if portions of the attesting platform were to agree to
perform attestation but others were to decline.

This demonstration does not utilize a hardware based measurement to act as the
"anchor" as described previously, because no such measurement is currently
bundled with Maat. This scenario serves as a demonstration of the workflow which
includes taking such a measurement but, due to this fact, cannot be taken to be
an operationalized version of this type of measurement without further ASP
development in Maat.

Layered Appraisal Demonstration
================================

This demo involves four AMs:
- AM_1 : Measurement Domain (DomM)
- AM_2 : Management Domain (Dom0)
- AM_3 : Target Domain (DomT)
- AM_4 : Appraisal Platform

In order to exercise this use-case in its most truest sense, AM_1, AM_2, and
AM_3 would all be operating in various domains on the same hypervisor enabled
host, while AM_4 should operate on a separate platform with no specific
constraints. If this is impractical, however, all 4 AMs could operate on
different Virtual Machines (VM), or even the same VM. Although neither
configuration would capture the trust relationship between the measurements that
is desired, either configuration could be sufficient to demonstrate that the
plumbing of this use case is operational.

In this demo, we will demonstrate this use case on a hypervisor based platform
as it is intended to be used. More specifically, AM_1, AM_2, and AM_3 are
running on domains of the hypervisor platform P_1, while AM_4 is running on a
separate platform P_2 that can communicate with P_1.

Explanation of Demo
-------------------
Here's what will happen in the demo:

.. code-block:: none

        1. The requester sends a request to AM_4 running on P_1 to appraise an
        attestation of the resource 'layered-attestation'

           The Copland phrase that the client will request is the following:
           * @_md(@_0(runtime_meas_sign)-<-@_0(USM full)-<-KIM runtime_meas_sign-<-USM full-<-@_t(runtime_meas_sign)-<-@_t(USM full))
                 _______________
                |      P_1      |
                |   (1) ______  |
               R------>|      | |
                |      | AM_4 | |
                |      |______| |
                |_______________|

        2. AM_4 triggers a negotiation with AM_1 in order to determine if it is
           willing and able to take the measurement represented by the phrase.
                                               ________________________
                                              |          P_2           |
                _______________               |         ______         |
               |      P_1      |              |        |      |        |
               |      ______   |              |        | AM_2 |        |
               |     |      |  |     (2)      |        |______|        |
               |     | AM_4 |<--------'       |   ______      ______   |
               |     |______|  |      |       |  |      |    |      |  |
               |_______________|      '--------->| AM_1 |    | AM_3 |  |
                                              |  |______|    |______|  |
                                              |________________________|

        3. After deciding that the phrase is satisfactory, AM_1 forks the Layered
           Attestation APB to take the measurement while AM_4 forks the APB which
           will appraise the measurement.

                                              |________________________|

        4. Given the ordering within the Copland phrase, the Layered Attestation APB
           spawns the Send Execute TCP ASP to send an execute contract to AM_2 for
           the phrase (KIM runtime_meas_sign), which takes a runtime measurement of
           the kernel.

        5. AM_2 spawns the KIM APB, which in turn, spawns the KIM ASP, in order to take
           a runtime integrity measurement of the kernel of Dom0.

               |________________________|

        6. The results of the KIM measurement are sent from the KIM APB in AM_2 to the
           Send Execute TCP ASP forked from the Layered Attestation APB in AM_1. This
           involves a set of ASPs we will call the sign-send pipeline. The relevant ASPs include the:
               * Serialize ASP - serialize a measurement graph into a buffer
               * Compress ASP - compresses the serialized measurement buffer
               * Create Contract ASP - creates the measurement contract which holds the
                                       measurement
               * Encrypt ASP - encrypts the measurement and contract
               * Send ASP - sends the encrypted buffer to the intended recipient
           For the sake of brevity, we will refer to these ASPs in aggregate as the
           sign-send pipeline in future.

        7. The Send Execute TCP ASP in AM_1 receives the measurement contract from AM_2.

        8. The Layered Attestation APB extracts the measurement from the measurement contract received
           from AM_2 using a set of ASPs we will collectively refer to as the execute-receive pipeline.
           The relevant ASPs include the:
               * Verify Contract ASP - verifies that the measurement contract is cryptographically
                                       signed, if that is required for this interaction, and well
                                       formed. Unlike the other ASPs, this does not process the
                                       contract and write out the transformation of this processing,
                                       but rather writes a boolean response as to whether the contract
                                       was successfully verified
               * Decrypt ASP - Decrypts the contents of the measurement contract
               * Decompress ASP - Decompresses the serialized measurement buffer
           For the sake of brevity, we will refer to these ASPs in aggregate as the
           receive-verify pipeline in future.

        9. The measurement is extracted from the measurement contract and is placed into the measurement
           graph being developed in AM_1.

        10. Given the ordering within the Copland phrase, the Layered Attestation APB
            spawns the Send Execute TCP ASP to send an execute contract to AM_2 for
            the phrase (USM full), which orchestrates measurements of the userspace
            environment of Dom0.

        11. AM_2 spawns the USM APB, which in turn, spawns a set of ASPs which collect
            measurements of the userspace environment of Dom0.

        12. The results of the USM measurement are sent from the USM APB in AM_2 to the
            Send Execute TCP ASP forked from the Layered Attestation APB in AM_1. This is
            done using the sign-send pipeline of ASPs.

        13. The Send Execute TCP ASP in AM_1 receives the measurement contract from AM_2.
            At this point, AM_2 plays no further role in this scenario.

        27. The now completed measurement graph in AM_1 is placed into a
            measurement contract and sent to AM_4 for appraisal. This is done
            using the sign-send pipeline of ASPs. At this point AM_1, and by
            extension, P_2, no longer plays a role in this scenario.

        28. At this point, the Layered Attestation Appraisal APB in AM_4
            receives the measurement contract from AM_1 using a set of ASPs
            that include some of the same ASPs as the execute-receive pipeline,
            but also includes other. The ASPs used are as follows:
                * Receive ASP - receives a buffer from a socket
                * Verify Contract ASP - verifies that the measurement contract is cryptographically
                                        signed, if that is required for this interaction, and well
                                        formed. Unlike the other ASPs, this does not process the
                                        contract and write out the transformation of this processing,
                                        but rather writes a boolean response as to whether the contract
                                        was successfully verified
                * Decrypt ASP - Decrypts the contents of the measurement contract
                * Decompress ASP - Decompresses the serialized measurement buffer
                * Deserialize ASP - Deserialize the measurement graph from the measurement buffer
            For the sake of brevity, we will refer to this as the receive-graph pipeline.

        29. The Layered Appraisal APB in AM_4 launches a set of ASPs in order to
            appraise the measurement graph from AM_1 and from those appraisals
            determines an overall appraisal result.

        30. The Layered Appraisal APB in AM_4 sends a response contract to the
            requester which includes the overall appraisal result. At this
            point, the scenario is complete.

Process
-------

A prerequisite to running this demo is an operational platform running a
hypervisor. This demo is agnostic to the choice of hypervisor, but this guide
recommends the use of Xen. For information regarding the installation of Xen, as
well as the creation of networking resources and user domains, please consult
the following page:
`https://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/Xen_Project_Beginners_Guide`. You will need to
create 2 user domains, one of which will be the DomM and the other of which will
be the DomT. All domains, including Dom0, must be installed with an operating
system that is supported by Maat. Furthermore, your hypervisor must be
configured to, at a minimum, allow network communication between DomM and all of
the other domains on the platform.

In addition, there must be another platform on which the appraiser will
operate. This platform, unlike the attesting environment, can simply be a
virtual machine or bare metal installation running an operating system supported
by Maat.

On each domain or virtual machine, Maat must be installed. In order to install
Maat, follow the directions that are located in the :ref:`Quick Start Guide
<quick_start>` and ensure that Maat is working correctly with the example
scenarios outlined in the :ref:`Basic Tutorial <basic_tutorial>`.

The demo setup will look as follows:

.. code-block:: none

                                        ________________________
                                       |          P_2           |

        |   |______|   |               |  |      |    |      |  |
        |______________|               |  | DomM |    | DomT |  |
                                       |  |______|    |______|  |
                                       |________________________|



P_1 is the appraising platform and P_2 is the platform being measured. The test
client requesting the measurement will be launched on VM_1.

Some network configuration will need to be performed to enable the connectivity
between the different AMs involved in this demo. We will need to assign an IP
address for each host and ensure that a specific port is open on each. For each
host these are as follows:

On DomM:

   Set IP to 192.168.0.5 and open port 2342

On Dom0:

   Set IP to 192.168.0.10 and open port 2342

On DomT:

   Set IP to 192.168.0.7 and open port 2342

On VM_1:

   Set IP to 192.168.0.3 and open port 2342

Setting the IP address and opening the ports require a specific set of
commands. For the rest of the demo setup, we will assume that the network
interface that is being used for each host is enp0s8. This may be different for
your specific installation. Use the following commands on each machine to set
the IP address and open the port:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo ifconfig enp0s8 <ip address> netmask 255.255.255.0 \
         broadcast 192.168.0.255
    firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=<port number>/tcp

Note: if you restart your machines, the ports opened in the commands above will
need to be reopened (can add `--permanent` flag to avoid this; see `firewall-cmd` man pages).

For each Attestation Manager, you will need to copy
`demo/ancillary_files/layered-am-config.xml` to `/opt/maat/etc/maat/`. It is
worth exploring a specific change in the AM configuration file that we are using
which makes it distinct from the AM configuration that is traditionally used for
Maat. For this demo, we set the interface on which the AM listens for
negotiation requests to permit other AMs to make measurement requests which can
bypass negotiation. This means that if another AM sends an AM configured in this
manner an execute contract for a specific Copland phrase, the receiving AM will
accept this execute contract, execute the APB corresponding to the Copland
phrase specified in the contract, and send a measurement contract back to the
requesting AM, even though no negotiation occurred. This is an insecure setting
which should not be used in a production environment, but is suitable for a demo
in order to simplify the configuration. Although the plumbing exists within Maat
to support bypassing negotiation, there currently is not a capability to
generate and keep track of a list of privileged hosts from which an AM may
permit bypassing negotiation. This is future work which is on our roadmap.

The Layered Appraisal use case will rely upon a backend database with the
IP address and port information for Dom0 and DomT. This is intended to simulate
an environment in which all of the domains on the hypervisor platform are registered
with the measurement domain. This allows DomM to forward requests for measurements to
the other domains. A simple CSV example file is provided with the Maat repository, and
can be installed where each AM can use it using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo cp demo/ancillary_files/layered-places.csv /opt/maat/etc/maat

To start the scenario, you must start all of the AMs. To do so, run

On DomM:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo LIBMAAT_LOG_SYSLOG=0 /opt/maat/bin/attestmgr -i 192.168.0.5:2342 \
    -C /opt/maat/etc/maat/layered-am-config.xml -m COPLAND

On Dom0:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo LIBMAAT_LOG_SYSLOG=0 /opt/maat/bin/attestmgr -i 192.168.0.10:2342 \
    -C /opt/maat/etc/maat/layered-am-config.xml -m COPLAND

On DomT:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo LIBMAAT_LOG_SYSLOG=0 /opt/maat/bin/attestmgr -i 192.168.0.7:2342 \
    -C /opt/maat/etc/maat/layered-am-config.xml -m COPLAND

On VM_1:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo LIBMAAT_LOG_SYSLOG=0 /opt/maat/bin/attestmgr -i 192.168.0.3:2342 \
     -C /opt/maat/etc/maat/layered-am-config.xml -m COPLAND

To take the measurement, you must invoke the test client in a separate
terminal on VM_1 using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    /opt/maat/bin/test_client -l 192.168.0.3 -t 192.168.0.5 -a 2342 \
    -p 2342 -r layered-attestation

You should see movement from each AM corresponding to the expected actions in
the diagram above. This demo will take a relatively long time to complete due to
the number of measurements to be executed. A `<result>PASS</result>` in the test
client's terminal indicates success.
