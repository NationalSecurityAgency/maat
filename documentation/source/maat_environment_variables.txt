Maat Environment Variables
****************************

Purpose and Intended Audience
==============================

This section will provide a user with a summary of the Maat environment.
A user can modify these environment variables to alter Maat behavior.
A primary reason to modify the Maat environment is to configure Maat
to report more verbose information in its logs.

The intended audience for this section is a system administrator who is
attempting to troubleshoot why attestation results or general behavior
are not as expected.

Verbose Logging
================

LIBMAAT_LOG_SYSLOG
-------------------

If set to 1, this will cause dlog() statements to call syslog(). If
set to 0, this will cause dlog() statements to call fprintf() and
print to the terminal.  This will usually be set to 0.

.. Table:: LIBMAAT_LOG_SYSLOG Supported Settings

    ======= =========== =============================
     Value     Enum         Description
    ======= =========== =============================
       0     LOG_EMERG	 System Unusuable
       1     LOG_ALERT   Action Must Be Taken
    ======= =========== =============================


.. seealso:: https://linux.die.net/man/3/syslog

LIBMAAT_DEBUG_LEVEL
--------------------

Sets the verbosity of the terminal output. The dlog level must be less
than or equal to the LIBMAAT_DEBUG_LEVEL in order to be printed to the
terminal.  For example, for a LIBMAAT_DEBUG_LEVEL of 1, which is the 
default value at system startup, only dlog statements of level 1 and 0
will be printed.  For a LIBMAAT_DEBUG_LEVEL of 2, only dlog statements
of level 2, 1, and 0 will be printed, etc.
