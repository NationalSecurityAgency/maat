	  This is a measurement specification for got/plt measurement
	</description>

	<!-- The variables listed below are measured according to the instructions
	     given here. Additional measurement variables are identified by retrieving
	     a 'feature' of a completed measurement, and are subsequently measured using
	     the referenced instruction.-->
