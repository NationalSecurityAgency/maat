In order to setup the pam_svp module, you will need to copy the generated .so
file into your systems well-known pam module directory.  For Fedora this
locations is in /lib(64)/security/ (searching for default pam modules could help
locate the correct directory location, pam_unix.so would be a good one to search
for) "sudo cp ./pam/.libs/libpam_svp.so.0.0.0 /lib/security/"

Next in order to modify a service to use the pam_svp module, you will need to
modify it's file in /etc/pam.d/ (in old setups, it will be /etc/pam.conf).
Within this directory is a file for each pam-aware service. In order to add
pam_svp to be applied to a service, you will open up the associated file and add
the following line to the config "auth		[required/requisite/optional]
pam_svp.so	[cmd-line args]"
