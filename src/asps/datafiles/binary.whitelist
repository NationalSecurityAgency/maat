# Binary whitelist file

# File names appearing in this list (one per line) are the only
# binaries allowed to have a writable .text ELF section header.
# The current version supports appraising binary files within the
# target directories /bin and /lib.
# Add binary names in the form /<target-dir>/<binary-name> (e.g., /bin/ls).
