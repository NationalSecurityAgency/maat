# Whitelist file for Memory Mapping Appraisal ASP
#
# This whitelist is generated by memorymapping_appraise_whitelist.sh
# The whitelist is used by the Memory Mapping Appraisal ASP.
# The whitelist contains a list of filesystems which provide an exceptional rule: a process spawned 
# from a particular file may have executable and writable memory mappings and may alter the in-memory 
# representation of the mapping.
