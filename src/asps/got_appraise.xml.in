	<usage>
                got_measure [graph path] [node id] [data type magic]</usage>
        <inputdescription>
        This ASP expects a measurement graph path, a node identifier, and a data type as arguments on the command line.
        The node identified must have target type process_target_type and address space pid_address_space and measurement type
        blob_measurement_type to represent the outcome of measuring the GOT of a single process.

        This ASP does not consume any input from stdin.</inputdescription>
        <outputdescription>
        This ASP adds raw data to the node id passed into the ASP. The raw data will include report information
	specifying if the GOT check passed, failed, or was unable to be taken.

        This ASP produces no output on stdout.</outputdescription>
