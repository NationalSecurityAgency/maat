	<description>SHA1 hash of target file</description>
	<usage>
        hashfileservice [graph path] [node id]</usage>
	<inputdescription>
        This ASP expects a measurement graph path and a node identifier as arguments on the command line.
        The node identified must have target type file_target_type and address space path_address_space
        to represent the location of the target file that needs to be hashed. 

        This ASP does not consume any input from stdin.</inputdescription>
	<outputdescription>
        This ASP produces a sha1hash_measurement_type measurement containing the hash of the file,
        and attaches it to the node passed as input.

        This ASP produces no output on stdout.</outputdescription>

	<example>
	Running hashfileservice with graph configured by graph-shell

           Terminal 1 (use graph-shell to create graph and insert node)
	   	> ./graph-shell
		> types /opt/maat/lib/libmaat_basetypes.so register_types
		>  new
		Graph created at /tmp/maatgraphO64qo5
		>  add-node 3e9 5f5f5f5f /bin/ls
		0000000000000000

	   Terminal 2 (run asp)
	   	> ./hashfileserviceasp /tmp/maatgraphO64qo5 0 

	   Terminal 1 (use graph-shell to display node contents)
	   	> node-type 0
		file 000003e9
		> ls-data 0
		00000c1c: sha1hashtype
		> cat-data 0 c1c
