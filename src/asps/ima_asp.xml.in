  <usage>
  ima [graph path] [node id]</usage>
  <inputdescription>
  This ASP expects a measurement graph path and a node identifier as arguments on the command line.
  The node identified must have target type file_target_type and address space path_address_space
  to represent the location which the ima measurement is added. 

  This ASP does not consume any input from stdin.</inputdescription>
  <outputdescription>
  This ASP produces an ima_measurement_type measurement containing the integrity information,
  and attaches it to the node passed as input.

  This ASP produces no output on stdout.</outputdescription>
