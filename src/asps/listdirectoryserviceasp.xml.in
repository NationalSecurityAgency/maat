	<description>List all entries in a given directory service</description>
	<usage>
		listdirectoryservice [graph path] [node id]</usage>
	<inputdescription> 
	This ASP expects a measurement graph path and a node identifier as arguments on the command line.
        The node identified must have target type file_target_type and address space path_address_space
        to indicate the target directory. The asp will parse the metadata of all entries of the target directory.

        This ASP does not consume any input from stdin.</inputdescription>
	<outputdescription>
	This ASP produces a new node for each entree of the target directory (filename and metadata). These new nodes are added to a list. The final list is added to the path_list measurement.

        The ASP marshals the path_list measurement contents and attaches the data to the node passed as input.

        This ASP produces no output on stdout.</outputdescription>
	<example>
	Running listdirectoryservice with graph configured by graph-shell

           Terminal 1 (use graph-shell to create graph and insert node)
                > ./graph-shell
                > types /opt/maat/lib/libmaat_basetypes.so register_types
                >  new
                Graph created at /tmp/maatgraphO64qo5
                >  add-node 3e9 7d0 /bin/
                0000000000000000

           Terminal 2 (run asp)
                > ./listdirectoryservice /tmp/maatgraphO64qo5 0

           Terminal 1 (use graph-shell to display node contents)
