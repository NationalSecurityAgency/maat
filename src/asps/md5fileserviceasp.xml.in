	<usage>
        md5fileservice [graph path] [node id]</usage>
        <inputdescription>
        This ASP expects a measurement graph path and a node identifier as arguments on the command line.
        The node identified must have target type file_target_type and address space path_address_space
        to represent the location of the target file that needs to be hashed.

        This ASP does not consume any input from stdin.</inputdescription>
        <outputdescription>
        This ASP produces an md5hash_measurement_type measurement containing the hash of the file,
        and attaches it to the node passed as input.

        This ASP produces no output on stdout.</outputdescription>
