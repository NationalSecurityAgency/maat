		procfds_asp [graph path] [node id]</usage>
	<inputdescription>
        This ASP expects a measurement graph path and a node identifier as arguments on the command line.
        The node identified must have target type file_contents_target_type and address space pid_address_space
        to represent the process. This ASP will open the /proc/[pid]/fd directory and stat all file paths found.

	This ASP does not consume any input from stdin.</inputdescription>
	<outputdescription>
	This ASP produces a file_address node containing the stat results of all paths found in /proc/[pid]/fd. These
	new nodes are then added as edges to the input node. 

	This ASP produces no output on stdout.</outputdescription>
