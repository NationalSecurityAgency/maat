	<description>Reads a range of memory from a running process and produces a sha256 hash of its contents</description>
	<usage> 
	procmem_asp [graph path] [node id]</usage>
	<inputdescription>
	This ASP expects a measurement graph path and a node identifier as arguments on the command line.
	The node identified must have target type process_target_type and address space pid_mem_range_space 
	to represent the process whose memory should be read and the starting virtual address and length to read 
	and hash.

	This ASP does not consume any input from stdin.</inputdescription>
	<outputdescription>
	This ASP produces a sha256_hash_measurement_type measurement containing the hash of the process' memory, 
	and attaches it to the node passed as input.

	This ASP produces no output on stdout.</outputdescription>
