	<inputdescription>
        This ASP expects a measurement graph path and a node identifier as arguments on the command line.
        The node identified must have target type process_target_type and address space pid_address_space
        to represent the path to the target process.

        This ASP does not consume any input from stdin.</inputdescription>
        <outputdescription>
        This ASP produces a new node for each entree of the target process path. These new nodes are added to a list. 
	The final list is added to the path_list measurement. 
        
	The ASP marshals the path_list measurement contents and attaches the data to the node passed as input. 

        This ASP produces no output on stdout.</outputdescription>
