        <inputdescription>
	  infd is not used. outfd is the file descriptor on which the results of the measurement
      should be written. app_addr and app_port are the address and port of the machine
      that should be responsible for appraising the measurement. att_addr and att_port are the
      address and port of the attesting machine. The resource is the measurement to be taken. 
      The nonce is the string that represents the freshness of the measurement.
	</inputdescription>
        <outputdescription>
	  This ASP writes the result contract received from the appraiser to outfd.
