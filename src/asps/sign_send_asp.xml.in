        <inputdescription>
	  graph path should be the path to a valid measurement graph. 
	  peerchan should be a channel to the measurement requestor.
	  partner_cert should be the certificate of the partner in the 
	  attestation.
	  certfile and keyfile are the files this ASP should use for signing 
	  the measurement.
	  sign_tpm is 1 if a TPM should be used for signing, 0 if not.
	  workdir is the working directory for the current attestation, where
	  this ASP will find the execute contract.
	</inputdescription>
        <outputdescription>
	  This ASP writes a signed, compressed, and encrypted contract 
	  containing the serialized contents of the passed measurement graph to
	  the peerchan passed.
