        <inputdescription>
	  fd_left and fd_right are the file descriptors corresponding to different ASPS which
      will consume the output of the fd_out ASP. fd_out is a file descriptor corresponding
      to an ASP that produces a blob. The left and right flags alter how the output blob is
      written for the left and right ASPS, respectively. As of now, the only modes are "all"
      or "none, which indicate that the whole blob, or none of it, shall be written to the ASP,
      respectively.
	</inputdescription>
        <outputdescription>
	  This ASP conditionally writes a blob to fd_left and fd_right
	</outputdescription>
</asp>
