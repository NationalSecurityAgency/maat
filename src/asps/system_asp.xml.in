                system_asp [graph path] [node id]</usage>
        <inputdescription>
	This ASP expects a measurement graph and a node identifier as arguments on the command line. 
	The node identified is not currently used, and is there to match other ASPs API???
	The ASP will parse the /etc/os-release file and records the distribution and version string of the 
	target machine's OS. 

        This ASP does not consume any input from stdin</inputdescription>
        <outputdescription>
	This ASP stores the distribution and version info into the measurement type system_measurement_type. 

        The ASP marshals the system_measurement_type measurement contents and creates a raw node, which is added to the graph that was passed in as input. 

        This ASP produces no output on stdout.</outputdescription>

	<example>
	Running systemasp with graph configured by graph-shell

	   Terminal 1 (use graph-shell to create graph and insert node)
        	> ./graph-shell
	        > types /opt/maat/lib/libmaat_basetypes.so register_types
        	>  new
	        Graph created at /tmp/maatgraphO64qo5
        	>  add-node 3e9 5f5f5f5f
	        0000000000000000

	   Terminal 2 (run asp)
        	> ./systemasp /tmp/maatgraphO64qo5 0

	   Terminal 1 (use graph-shell to display node contents)
		graph(/tmp/maatgraphQOdZih)> ls-data 0
		0000167d: system
		graph(/tmp/maatgraphQOdZih)> cat-data 0 167d
		distribution:		ubuntu
		version:	"14.04"
