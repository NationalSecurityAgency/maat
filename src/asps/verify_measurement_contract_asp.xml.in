	  fd_in is a file descriptor that this ASP will read a blob from
	  fd_out is a file descriptor where this ASP will write the verification
	  result to
	  workdir is a path to the working directory, where the ASP will find
	  the execute contract for this attestation
	  nonce is the nonce used for this scenario
	  cacert is the certificate that can verify the signatures in the contract
	  verify_tpm is a boolean, 1 if the signatures in the contract must be verified
	  by the TPM, and 0 otherwise
	</inputdescription>
        <outputdescription>
	  This ASP writes "PASS" if the verification succeeded and "FAIL" otherwise
